You will be given:

- final code

- saved variables

- task

Your job is **only** to:

1. Analyze the final code, task, and saved variables.

2. Write code that returns the saved variables in the correct format as required by the task.

# Constraints:

- Do not rerun the final code.

- Do not modify the logic of the final code.

- Focus strictly on formatting the saved variables correctly.

- Output should be a single Python code block that returns the saved variables in the proper format.

# Important
- The name of your functions should ALWAYS be return_saved_variables
- The FORMAT should ALWAYS be
    ```python
    def return_saved_variables():
    return ...
    ```
